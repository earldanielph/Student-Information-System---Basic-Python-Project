# Student Information System - Basic Python Project
# Evtech - Earl Daniel Villanueva

Hello everyone!

This is my assignment in the computer programming course in college. Basically, this simple Python project allows users to enter information for five students at the same time. After the user finishes entering the last piece of information about the student, they will get a message allowing them to print specific student information from the saved list.

The purpose of this Python script is to create a simple "Student Information System". It allows the user to add a new student to the system and view all the students stored in the system. When the program is run, the user is presented with a menu with three options: "Add Student", "View all Students", and "Exit". If the user selects the first option, they can input the information of a new student, including the student's name, student number, mobile number, email, and balance. The information of the new student is then stored in a list and added to a larger list of all students. If the user selects the second option, the program displays the information of all students stored in the system. If the user selects the third option, the program terminates. This script is a simple example of how to implement a basic student information system using Python. It can be used as a starting point for a more comprehensive and robust system.
